<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    My main research interest is in automated software testing, primarily targeting the JVM.
    As part of my PhD research, I am currently researching the idea to use biostatistical methods to quantify the performance of random fuzz testers.
    Specifically, my main hypothesis is that a fuzzer is more effective in finding bugs if it not only <em>covers</em> a lot of code, but also <em>diversely exercises</em> it
    â€” I call this concept <em>behavioral diversity</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02130">STADS framework</a>,
    I propose to measure behavioral diversity based on the execution distribution of a fuzzer,
    analogous to how ecologists quantify biodiversity over the species distribution of an assemblage.
    To this end, I research to what extent a fuzzer that exhibits higher behavioral diversity inspires more confidence in the correctness of the program under test.
    Moreover, I have proposed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510003.3510182">BeDivFuzz</a>, a coverage-guided fuzz testing technique that aims to diversely explore the program behaviors through an adaptive mutation strategy.

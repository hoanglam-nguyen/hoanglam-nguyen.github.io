Hi! My name is Lam and I'm a PhD student at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, advised by
[Prof. Dr. Lars Grunske](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske).
My main research interest is in automated software testing, using techniques like fuzz testing, search-based software testing (SBST), and symbolic execution.
